# Local-HTML-translation

This script loops through a directory, scan for text in the HTML files and translate to Hindi using googletrans library by Pypi
Problem, a large amount of data would be blocked by the service.

Known issue: Some texts wrapped around by "" or certain tags seems to be ignored by bs4's find_all() method


Disclaimer: I made this script following a request from a company called codingallstars.com for a python junior dev position
The request seemed shady as it asks us to scrape www.classcentral.com 1 level deep and translate like 100 HTMLs with google translate API
WITHOUT paying for the tool so we can do accordingly. 
Furthermore, they ask us to do this for a week, unpaid. While forcing us to practically "CLONE" the website to the tee with all working CSS and JS.
Hence, i did not go through with it, i don't wanna get in legal troubles.
but the script is avaiable here should anyone has problem tryign to translate like i did. 

I hope it's helpful and not scammy like the said company.
